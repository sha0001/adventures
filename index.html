<h1>Adventures in HTML and CSS</h1> 


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Initially the plan is to use this page to document my lessons in HTML and CSS, with the intention of developing enough understanding to create a functioning and aesthetically coherent webpage for the purposes of documenting whatever projects take my fancy. In the meantime please bear with the incredibly obtuse formatting.</p>


<h2> References </h2>

<p><mark><i>This section is to be moved into a side bar (?) at some stage</i></mark></p>


<h2> Displaying tags on an HTML page </h2>

<p>Writing the tags as written in the code will just process the tags along with all other HTML. <br>
	Any tags written on a HTML page (for example in building a tutorial) will need to be displayed as follows: </p>
	<pre>
	 <b>&amp;lt&#59;</b> will display as <b>&lt;</b><br>
	 <b>&amp;gt&#59;</b> will display as <b>&gt;</b><br></pre>
<p> For a full list of references for HTML entity codes click <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/charsets/ref_utf_basic_latin.asp"> here.</a></p>



<h2> Definitions</h2>
<p> This section of the page will be for defining the 'grammatical' terms for general structural elements in HTML and CSS. <br> This is distinguished from lists of specific tags or attributes in that it is designed to give a higher level view of the structure of the language</p>
 
 	<h3>HTML</h3>
 		<ul>
 			<li><b>Tags</b> - Are placed at the start and end of an element. Opening tags are surrounded by <b>&lt; &gt;</b>, while closing tags are displayed as <b>&lt;/&gt;</b>. <br>Some tags are open and do not require a closing tag. <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_byfunc.asp"> List of Tags by function</a></li>
			<li><b>Attributes</b> - Attributes allow you to customise a tag, and are defined within the opening tag <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_attributes.asp">List of Attributes</a></li>
 			<li><b>Elements</b> - An element is everything contained within two tags</li>
		</ul>
	<h3>CSS</h3>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Selector</b> - points to the html element you want to style. The tag heading without <b>&lt; &gt;</b>)</li>
			<li><b>Property</b> - The property of the element that you intend to change <i>eg. Color</i> <a href = "https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/">List of Properties</a></li>
			<li><b>Value</b> - The value you want the property to become. Can be a numerical or descriptive value <i>eg. "Blue"</i> </li>
			<li><b>Declaration</b> - A property and a Value, separated by <b>:</b>, finished with <b>;</b>
			<li><b>Declaration Block</b> - A series of declarations contained within curly brackets. <i>eg. {color:blue;font-size:12px;}</i></li>
			<li><b>Functions</b> - A function completes a task based on predetermined inputs. Arguments are placed within brackets after calling the function. To be used as values for properties. <br><i>eg. linear-gradient(red, yellow, green)</i> <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_functions.asp"> List of functions</a></li>
		</ul>
	

<h2> Minimum code </h2>
<p><i> This section will involve the creation of a template for the minimum code required to make a functional webpage. <br>This will include links to a style sheet for formatting, but little else. Non-essential items will be considered modular to be added after the fact. <br> This will allow for quick copying to create new pages within this site, as well as a standardized formatting to be consistent across the website. </i></p>


<h3> Required HTML</h3>

	<pre>
	<b>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</b><i> Defines which version of HTML is to be used.</i><br>
	<b>&lt;html&gt;</b><i> Marks that the following is in HTML</i><br>
	<b>&lt;head&gt;</b> <i> The 'head' tag is a container for metadata. It is not displayed. </i><br>
	<b>&lt;title&gt;&lt;/title&gt;</b><i> The Title of the page - displayed in Tabs and Search results</i><br>
	<b>&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"&gt; </b><i> Invokes CSS style sheet</i><br>
	<b>&lt;/head&gt;</b><br>
	<b>&lt;body&gt;</b><i> Marks the start of visible content</i><br>
	<b>&lt;/body&gt;</b><br>
	<b>&lt;/html&gt; </b><br></pre>

<p> In addition to the above tags, the html file needs to be saved as the <b>.html</b> file type.


<h3> Invoking CSS Style Sheet </h3>
<p> CSS can be invoked in three different ways: </p>
<ul>
	<li>In the HTML document header,placed between the &lt;style&gt; tags: <br>
		<pre>
		h1 {color: maroon; margin-left: 40px;}</pre></li>

	<li> Inline in the HTML document, within the "style" attribute of the relevant element<br>
	 	<pre>
	 	&lt;h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;"&gt;This is a heading&lt;/h1&gt;</pre></li>

	<li>In a separate style sheet, placing the following element between the &lt;head&gt; tags<br>
		<pre>
		&lt;link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="mystyle.css"&gt;  link </pre></li>
</ul>

<p>External style sheets are to be saved as the <b>.css</b> file type.</p>

<p>Multiple CSS sheets can be used simultaneously, but the most recently read will be used.</p>

<h2> Domain purchase options </h2>
	<ul>
		<li> Purchase cheap domain from <a href="https://au.auctions.godaddy.com/">auctions</a></li>
		<li> Buy an unclaimed name </li>
	</ul>
	
	<p> I have purchased my domain through <a href="https://domains.google/">Google Domains</a>, following recommendation from my friend Yutaka. <br><br>
		After reading up on some of the shady dealings with sites such as godaddy, I'd prefer to avoid this trouble by sticking with a reputable provider.<br> <br>
		Google also offers a number of inclusions like free privacy protection, email forwarding and redirection. <br><br>
		I have chosen the domain name www.7mec.com</p>
		

<h2> Web Hosting Options </h2>
<p>Currently this page is hosted on <a href="https://github.com"> Github</a>, as this suits my current development workflow of making edits to my webpage in a structured and reversible manner.
